Graphs
  Digraph  G = (V,E) 
    -set V vertices
    -set E in V*V
    |E| = O(V^2) connected=>|E|>|V|-1
  Graph reprentation
  Handshaking Lemma (undirected graph)
  sum(degree(v)) = 2|E|
  use theta(V+E)
  
  Minimum spanning tree
  Input:Connecte undirected graph 
   G =(V,E) with weight function w:E->R
   for simplicity,assume all edge weight are distinct
  Output:A spanning tree connected all vertices of minimum weight
  w(T) = sum(w((u,v)))
  
  optimal substructure
  remove (u,v) in T ,then T is parti into two trees
  Theorem T1  is MST for G1=(V1,E1),subgraph of G induce
  by vertices in T1
   v1 = vertices in T1
   E1 = {(x,y)} in E,x,y in V}
  Proof:
     cut&paste
     w(T) = w(u,v) + w(T1) + w(T2)

  hallmark for greedy algorithm
  Greedy-choice property:a locally optimal choice is globally optimal

  Theorem Let T be MST of G=(V,E),A in V ,suppose (u,v) in E
  is least-weight edge connecting A to V-A,then (u,v) in T
  
  Prim's algorithm
  Idea: maintain V-A as  a priority queue Q .key EACH VERTEX in Q with 
  weight of least-weight edge connectiong it to a vertex in A
  Q <-V
  key[v] <- infinity v in V
  key[s]<-0
   while Q!=ç©º
      do u<- Exract-Min(Q)
        for each u in Adj[u]
          do if v in Q and w(v) in key[v]
            then key[v]<-w(u,v)
              pi[v]<-u
