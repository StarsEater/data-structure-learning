Bellman - Ford algorithm
reports that negative weight cycle
D(s,v)
d[s]<-0
for each v in V-{s}
  do d[v]<-infinity
for i <-1 to |V|-1:
  do for each edge (u,v) in E
    do if d[v] > d[u] + weight(u,v)
       then d[v] = d[u] + weight(u,v)
for each edge (u,v) in E 
  do if d[v] > d[u] + w(u,v)
    then report that a negative-weight cycle
running time O(VE)
Correctness:
  if G = (V,E) has no negative cycles,then terminates with 
  d[v]=D(s,v) for all v in V
  By monotonicity & Correctness 1 (d[v] >= D(s,v)),need to prove 
  d[v] = D(s,v) at some time
  Let p = v1->v1->...->vk be a shortest path from s to v with 
  minimum number of edges => p is a simple path
  D(s,vi) = D(s,vi-1) + w(vi-1,vi)
  d[v0] = 0(init) D(s,v0) = 0;
  Assume by induction that d[vi] = D(s,vi) after j round (j<i)
  after i-1 rounds d[vi-1] = D(s,vi-1)
  during round i relax (vi-1,vi) 
  Correctness lemma ==> d[vi] = D(s,vi)
  After k rounds,d[v] = D(s,v) k = |V|-1
  
  Corollary if Bellman-Ford fails to converge after |V|-1 rounds
  must be a negative-weight cycle
  
  Linear programming
   given m*n matrix A, m-vector bi n-vector ci ,find n-vector x that maximizes c(T)x subject to Ax<=b
   Difference constraints  
      linear feasibility problem where each row of matrix has 1,-1,(rest) 0
   Constraint graph
    xi - xj <= wj ==> xi--wj--wj
    |V| = n ,|E| = m
    xj <= xi + wij
    d[xj] <= d[xi] + wij
   Theorem if constraint graph has neg-weight cycle then 
   difference constrainta are unsatisfiable
   Proof : 
   Let 
   
   Therorm : if no neg-weight cycle in constrainst graph G
   then difference constraints are satisfiable
   Proof : Add to G a new vertex s with a weight-o edge from s to all v in V
   modified graph has no neg-weight cycle & has path from s
   =>has shortest path from s 
   Assign xi = D(s,vi)
   xj-xi <=wij <=> D(s,vj) - D(s,vi) <= wij
                   D(s,vj) <= D(s,vi) + wij
